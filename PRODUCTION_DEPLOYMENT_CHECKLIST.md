## üìã Deployment Steps

### 1. Create Missing Assets

#### Favicon
```bash
# Create a 32x32 or 16x16 favicon.ico
# Add to <head> section of index.html:
<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/favicon.ico">
```

#### Open Graph Image
```bash
# Create a 1200x630px image for social media sharing
# Place as og.png in root directory
# Image should represent the brand/identity of Will Hewitt
```

### 2. Verify External Links
- Test all external project links are accessible
- Update Twitter link with actual profile URL or remove if not applicable
- Verify email link opens mail client correctly

# Optimize images
# Use imageoptim, TinyPNG, or similar tools
```

- AWS S3 + CloudFront
- Cloudflare Pages

**No server-side rendering or backend required**

### 6. Post-Deployment Testing

- [ ] Test on actual mobile devices
- [ ] Verify analytics tracking works
- [ ] Check all internal navigation links
- [ ] Test all interactive features
- [ ] Verify loading performance with browser DevTools
- [ ] Check console for errors

### 7. SEO Post-Launch
- [ ] Submit sitemap to Google Search Console
- [ ] Verify robots.txt if needed
- [ ] Test social media preview with Facebook Debugger and Twitter Card Validator
- [ ] Monitor Core Web Vitals

## üîç Browser Compatibility

Tested on:
- ‚úÖ Chrome (via Playwright automation)
